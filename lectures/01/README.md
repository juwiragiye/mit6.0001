# What is computation?

- ## What does a computation do?

  - Perform calculations.
  - Store data in memory.

- ## Types of knoweledge

  - Declative kowledge: statement of fact.
  - Imperative knowledge: "how to".

- ## What is a simple a receipe/algorithm?

  - Steps.
  - Flow of control.
  - Stop case.

- ## Types of computers?

  - Fixed computers: it can only do one thing.
  - Stored program computers: it can store and execute a sequence of instructions.

- ## Basic computer architecture

  - Memory
  - ALU
  - I/O
  - CONTROL UNIT

- ## You can program a computer using the following 6 primitives shown by Turing

  1. move right
  2. move left
  3. read
  4. write
  5. scan
  6. do nothing

  Using those 6 instructions, programming languages come about to be
  . In theory, a computer program wrtitten in one high level programming language can be translated to another programming language.

- ## Aspects of a programming languages

  - Syntax: both syntactically and semantically correct.
  - Semantics: instructions only have one meaning and it not be on what you wanted hence debbuging.
